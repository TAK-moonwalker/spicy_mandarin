            <h3>About SPICY MANDARIN</h3><br>
            <p>
              SPICY MANDARIN is an educational institution that uses unconventional but memorable methods in teaching Mandarin to our passionate students with our sexy celebrity teachers.<br>
              SexyMandarin started off with a group of people who had a fun idea of shooting sexy Chinese girls that could teach Mandarin Chinese in short 2 minute clips. After editing the clip, we decided to post our first video, “Lesson 1: What time is it?” on youtube where it became viral.<br>
              The project has been featured in various publications from “The Daily Telegraph” to “Huffington Post”, and even mentioned by Jimmy Falllon, in his U.S. prime time show. With it’s popularity, the SexyMandarin youtube channel has over 2 million hits and counting.<br>
