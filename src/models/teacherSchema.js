But most of my close friends think I could be funny, silly and a bit crazy sometimes.</p><p><em><strong>What kind of men would get your attention?</strong></em><br>At first meeting, I’m usually got attention by someone who has a big smile and confidence to talk in front of people. But for real relationship, I would prefer someone who know about his goal and achieve it bravely.</p><p><em><strong>What’s best advice for students who want to learn Chinese?</strong></em><br>Watch Chinese movies or TV shows as much as you can, and try to memorize useful sentences that you think is helpful, and use it properly in the right situations!</p><p><em><strong>What other job experiences do you have?</strong></em><br>I’m also an Instructional Designer, be part of R and D team as a chief planner and developer for Mandarin teaching material and syllabus. Lecturing of Foreign-Language-Aided Mandarin Teaching Training Program at University. Holding TOCFL(Test of Chinese as Foreign Language) test, Taiwan Higher Education Fair, Taiwan movie day, Education Seminar and Chinese cultural festival.</p><p><em><strong>What are your hobbies/ interests?</strong></em><br>After work I love to take some yoga classes and reading. Well, life is not easy, especially we have to wake up every early morning, haha, so I like to sleep in on weekends, and hang out with friends. We usually have theme plan for every gathering, like be a volunteer to take care of children, watch stage drama, riding bicycle, visiting exhibitions and traveling.</p><p><em><strong>What Chinese dish would you recommend a foreigner to try?</strong></em><br>I would say “Steamed Dumpling” at Din Tai Fung restaurant, in Chinese we called it “Xiăolongbāo” or “tāngbāo”.<br>Bite-sized xiăolongbāo have a consistently high qual. Their paper-thin wrappings hold rich hot broth and tender pork meatballs. Gasps can be heard intermittently as diners brave the scalding hot soup that squirts out upon biting the dumpling. Sounds attractive? Why not give it a try!</p><p><em><strong>How would you compare Chinese women to other nationalities?</strong></em><br>I think most Chinese women are family-oriented, caring, and respectful.</p></div>',

For leisure time, I like hiking and spending time on the beach. I also like reading novels, my favourite authors are Nora Roberts, James Patterson, and Stephen King.</p><p><em><strong>What Chinese dish would you recommend foreigner to try?</strong></em></p><p>I love Chinese skewers! If you wander around mainland China, you can see so many barbecue setup everywhere. I highly recommend you to pick one, sit down, order some local beer, and gulp tons of different skewers. I will be an unforgettable experience for you.</p><p><em><strong>What’s best advice for students who wants to learn Chinese?</strong></em></p><p>Pinyin is very important if you wanna start to speak Chinese as soon as possible. It happens so many times that the pinyin for certain word is very difficult to pronounce. In such situation, I suggest you to relate the sound to your mother tongue. For instance, the pinyin for ‘茶 (tea)’ is ‘cha’; it sounds basically the same with ‘char’ in ‘charge’. Keep notes about similar situations you encounter, I do believe it can be very helpful.</p><p><em><strong>What kind of men would get your attention?</strong></em></p><p>For completely strangers, I like tall guys, who give me a sense of safety. But after getting to know each other for a while, I tend to like hard-working and considerate guys.</p><p><em><strong>How do you compare Chinese women to other nationalities?</strong></em></p><p>Everyone knows you can never guess the real age of Asian women! I think Chinese women are youthful and energetic, but very conscious about the limit. We don’t overuse body to age faster, haha. Additionally, Chines ladies contribute a lot to their families and usually cook well.</p></div>',
